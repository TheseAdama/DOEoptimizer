# DOEoptimizer

**DOEoptimizer** is an R package that provides several optimization algorithms designed to optimize design of physical experiments criteria (matrix input functions). 
It offers tools and utilities for constructing optimal design of experiments through genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, stochastic optimization, or greedy algorithm.

## Description

The **DOEoptimizer** package implements five optimization algorithms tailored for optimizing the criteria of physical experiment designs. These algorithms work with matrix input objective functions.

Included algorithms:

- `GEAoptim`: Genetic Algorithm Optimization
- `SAoptim`: Simulated Annealing Optimization
- `FIBoptim`: Forward, Improvement, and Backward Greedy Optimization
- `SPSAoptim`: Stochastic Optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation
- `Gridoptim`: Greedy Forward Optimization

## Installation

You can install the package via GitHub, or manually load it into your R session:

```r
devtools::install_github("TheseAdama/DOEoptimizer")
```
